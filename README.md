Brisophone
==========
This is a semi-random music generator based on a STM32F4 Discovery board and a simple expansion board providing four push buttons and a 10 LED bargraph.

It's a cousin of my previous "Ambiantiseur" project.

Now we have 3 effects : LP filter, chorus/flanger, delay.

Through the 4 buttons you can edit about 20 parameters.
